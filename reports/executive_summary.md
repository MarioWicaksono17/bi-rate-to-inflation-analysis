# Executive Summary

## Background

Monetary policy plays a central role in stabilizing inflation. In Indonesia, the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate serves as the primary policy instrument used by Bank Indonesia to manage price stability.

This project examines how changes in the BI Rate are associated with inflation movements during 2016–2025.

## Key Findings

1. No strong immediate relationship is observed between changes in the BI Rate and inflation.
2. A stronger negative relationship emerges after approximately 3–4 months.
3. The relationship between policy rate and inflation appears dynamic rather than instantaneous.

---

## Interpretation

The results suggest that monetary policy transmission to inflation operates with a time lag. Changes in the policy rate do not immediately translate into inflation adjustments but appear to influence inflation gradually over several months.

---

## Policy Implication

The findings align with standard monetary transmission theory, where interest rate adjustments influence demand, credit conditions, and economic activity before affecting price levels.

This highlights the importance of forward-looking policy decisions.

## Limitations

- The analysis is based on bivariate models.
- External factors (global shocks, fiscal policy, exchange rates) are not explicitly controlled.
- Correlation does not imply strict causality.

Further structural modeling would be required to establish causal inference.
